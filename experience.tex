\section{Experience}
\experience{\textbf{PayPal}}{Vancouver, Canada}{Software Engineer, Payouts}{Mar 2023 - Present}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item {
        Secured \textbf{GraphQL} service against 1 critical vulnerability by implementing authentication component that issues and verifies 48 thousand tokens (\href{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519}{RFC 7519}) per day. Used \textbf{Payara} server, \textbf{HazelCast} queue \& cache, \textbf{MySQL}, \textbf{EclipseLink} and \textbf{EJB} dependency injection.
    }
    \item {
        Detected an attack, traffic 64 times more than average by instrumenting authentication component, building \textbf{Splunk} dashboard and alarms that notified team instantly.
    }
    \item {
        Correlated \textbf{iOS} and \textbf{Android} client events with \textbf{Payara} server logs, making it easier to triage bugs and solve customer issues. Achieved this by augmenting logs with unique identifiers.
    }
    \item {
        Sped up authentication latency ($\approx$ 30\%) by making database calls asynchronous and using cache "\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)#Writing_policies}{write back}" strategy rather than "\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)#Writing_policies}{write through}".
    }
\end{itemize}

\experience{\textbf{Amazon}}{Vancouver, Canada}{Software Engineer, Automated Ads}{Jun 2022 - Mar 2023}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item {
        Secured alpha-beta ads testing platform by configuring an \textbf{Apache Tomcat} reverse-proxy and creating private networks on \textbf{Amazon Web Services} using the \textbf{Cloud Development Kit} to authenticate and authorise all internal traffic.
    }
    \item {
        Saved 7 days per quarter ($\approx$ 10\%) of developer labour by automating alpha-beta ads testing using Amazon \textbf{Event Bridge}, \textbf{SQS}, \textbf{Lambda}, and Google \textbf{Guice} dependency injection. Wrote unit and integration tests.
    }
    \item {
        Reduced severity-2 tickets ($\approx$ 10\%) by eliminating “ec2 is out of capacity” error for \textbf{Spark} clusters using \textbf{CloudWatch} alarms on the number of instances in an availability zone.
    }
\end{itemize}

\experience{\textbf{Visier}}{Vancouver, Canada}{Software Engineer Intern, Build Systems}{May 2021 - Dec 2021}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item {
        Monitored \textbf{Gradle} task adoption, execution time, and exception frequency by implementing telemetry plugin. Designed plugin to be fault-tolerant, efficient, and respectful of privacy.
    }
    \item {
        Configured \textbf{Consul} and \textbf{Docker} to allow containerized services to discover each other.
    }
    \item {
        Created \textbf{Bitbucket} plugin to notify \textbf{Slack} of pull requests modifying a given file or branch.
